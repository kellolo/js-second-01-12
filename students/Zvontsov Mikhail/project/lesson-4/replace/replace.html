    <p class="text">Waiter: 'Welcome to our restaurant. Did you book a table in advance?'
        David: 'Hello. Yes, we ordered a table for Laurins.'
        W: 'All right. Follow me. Here's your table, as you wanted, by the window. Let me take your and your lady's
        coats.'
        D: 'Yes, please. Sit down, dear.'
        W: 'Check out our menu. I'll come in a minute ... Are you ready to order?'
        D: 'No, not yet. Give us a little time to study the menu.'
        W: 'Good. Call me when you're ready.'
        D: 'Darling, what will you eat?'
        Amanda: Oh, there is such a chic choice of dishes. I am even confused. What would you advise?'
        D: 'I can recommend fried duck with cream sauce. A tasty dish. The fish here is also gorgeous. Actually, the
        chef in this restaurant is a true master. All his dishes are delicious.'
        A: 'Then I'll order a salad with seafood and a duck.'
        D: 'And the dessert?'
        A: 'I would like to try a cheesecake. I love to cook it myself, but I will not refuse from the ready dish.'
        A: 'Excellent. Waiter!'
        W: 'I'm listening to you.'
        D: 'Bring us, please, a salad with seafood and a duck for the lady, and I'll order a julien with mushrooms and
        entrecote.'
        W: 'Will you order the dessert?'
        D: 'Yes, of course. One cheesecake and a slice of banana cake.'
        W: 'What will you drink?'
        D: 'Today we have a holiday, an anniversary, which means that we will drink champagne.'
        W: 'Dry, sweet or semisweet?'
        D: 'White semisweet.'
        W: 'Excellent choice. Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Shall I bring the champagne right now?'
        D: 'Yes, so it will not be boring to wait for our order.'
        W: 'Here is your champagne. And this is a gift from the chef in honor of your holiday.'
        D: 'Thank you very much. We are very pleased!'
        A: 'Your order, sir. Anything else?'
        D: 'Thank you. All is perfect.'</p>
